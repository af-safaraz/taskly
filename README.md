# Taskly - A Simple Task Management App

Live on: https://taskly-sfrz.vercel.app/

Taskly is a simple yet functional to-do app that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. I built this project to deepen my understanding of React, TypeScript, Material UI, and API handling while working on a real-world application. This project also served as an opportunity for me to explore state management, API integration, and UI design in a structured way. I used Redux Toolkit to manage global state and API interactions efficiently. By using MockAPI.io as a backend, I was able to simulate real API interactions, making the project feel more dynamic and interactive.

> :warning: Note: This app is not ready for actual use yet, as there is no authentication system in place. This means that all users are accessing the same shared task list.

Features:

- Add, edit, and remove tasks
- Assign a due date to tasks
- View all tasks, today's tasks, or tasks due in the next 7 days
- Mark tasks as complete
